Class method vs Static Method
1. A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
2. A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
3. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters 
    and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
4. We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
